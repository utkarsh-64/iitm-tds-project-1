(Don\u2019t exceed that.)\n\nRead the [AI Pipe documentation](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe) to learn how to use it. But in short:\n\n1. Replace `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, i.e. `https://api.openai.com/v1` with `https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1...` or `https://aipipe.org/openai/v1...`\n2. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the [`AIPIPE_TOKEN`](https://aipipe.org/login)\n3. Replace model names, e.g. `gpt-4.1-nano`, with `openai/gpt-4.1-nano`\n\nFor example, let\u2019s use [Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-0-flash-lite) via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001) for chat completions and [Text Embedding 3 Small](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-small) via [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) for embeddings:\n\n```\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\",\n    \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }]\n  }'\n\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + "

Your usage is limited to **$1 per calendar month** for this course. Don\u2019t exceed that.\n\n**Use [AI Proxy](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy)** instead of OpenAI. Specifically:\n\n1. Replace your API to `https://api.openai.com/...` with `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...`\n2.

The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it\u2019s a public data source. But that\u2019s the first way\u2014you download the data.\n2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.\n3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It\u2019s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It\u2019s available on a PDF file. It\u2019s available in a Word document. It\u2019s available on an Excel file. It\u2019s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.\n\nIn this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.\n\n[![Data Sourcing - Introduction](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1LyblMkJzOo/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/1LyblMkJzOo)\n\nHere are links used in the video:\n\n* [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)\n* [IMDb Datasets](https://imdb.com/interfaces/)\n* [Download the IMDb Datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/)\n* [Explore the Internet Movie Database](https://gramener.com/imdb/)\n* [What does the world search for?](https://gramener.com/search/)\n* [HowStat - Cricket statistics](https://howstat.com/cricket/home.asp)\n* [Cricket Strike Rates](https://gramener.com/c"

It\u2019s essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\n\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):\n\n[![What is Base64? (3 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8qkxeZmKmOY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY)\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\n* It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n* \u2026 using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4)\n* There\u2019s a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs\n* Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\n\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\n\n```\nimport base64\n\n# Basic encoding/decoding\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n# Convert text to base64\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Convert base64 back to text\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        # Hello, World!\n# Convert to URL-safe base64\nurl_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n\n# Working with binary files (e.g., images)\nwith open('image.png', 'rb') as f:\n    binary_data = f.read()\n    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()\n\n# Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\ndata_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s an SVG image embedded as a data URI:\n\n```\n<img\n  src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PH"

Here\u2019s a sample `Dockerfile` that converts a Python script into a container image.\n\n```\nFROM python:3.11-slim\n# Set working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n# Typically, you would use `COPY . .` to copy files from the host machine,\n# but here we're just using a simple script.\nRUN echo 'print(\"Hello, world!\")' > app.py\n# Run the script\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nTo build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands:\n\n```\n# Create an account on https://hub.docker.com/ and then login\npodman login docker.io\n\n# Build and run the container\npodman build -t py-hello .\npodman run -it py-hello\n\n# Push the container to Docker Hub.

These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\n\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\n\n1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query.\n2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories.\n3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters.\n4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text.\n\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.\n\n| Feature | Local Models | API |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Privacy** | High | Dependent on provider |\n| **Cost** | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go |\n| **Scale** | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand |\n| **Quality** | Varies by model | Typically high |\n\nThe [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:\n\n1. **Rank**. Higher ranked models have higher quality.\n2. **Memory Usage**. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.\n3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.\n4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a *single* input.\n5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.\n\n### [Local Embeddings](#/embeddings?id=local-embeddings)\n\n[![Guide to Local Embeddings with Sentence Transformers](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OATCgQtNX2o/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OATCgQtNX2o)\n\nHere\u2019s a minimal example using a local embedding model"

Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time.\n\nHere are things you should know when you\u2019re compressing images:\n\n* **Image dimensions** are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot\n* **Lossless** compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data\n* **Lossy** compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files\n* **Vector** formats (SVG) scale without quality loss\n* **WebP** is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless\n\nHere\u2019s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025.\n\n* Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it\u2019s vector graphics or you can convert it to one)\n* Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP\n\nCommon operations with Python:\n\n```\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport io\n\nasync def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\"\n    with Image.open(input_path) as img:\n        # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed\n        if img.mode == 'RGBA':\n            img = img.convert('RGB')\n        # Optimize for web\n        img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True)\n\n# Batch process images\npaths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg')\nfor p in paths:\n    await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp'))Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nCommand line tools include [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp), [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/).\n\n```\n# Convert to WebP\ncwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp\n\n# Optimize PNG\npngquant --quality=65-80 image.png\n\n# Optimize JPEG\njpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image.jpg\n\n# Convert"

This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\n\n**Example:** Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\n\n```\nimport ijson\n\nasync def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\"\n    results = []\n\n    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:\n        # Stream objects under the 'items' key\n        parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')\n        async for item in parser:\n            if item['value'] > 100:  # Process conditionally\n                results.append(item)\n\n    return resultsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Pandas JSON Columns](#/parsing-json?id=pandas-json-columns)\n\n[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.\n\n**Example:** Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Parse JSON strings in a column\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']})\ndf['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize)\n\n# Normalize nested JSON columns\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndf_normalized = pd.json_normalize(\n    df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads),\n    record_path=['items"

Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.\n\n**Example:** Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.\n\n```\nSELECT\n    json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name,\n    avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value\nFROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl')\nGROUP BY 1\nHAV"

This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows.\n\n### [Key Concepts](#/scheduled-scraping-with-github-actions?id=key-concepts)\n\n* **Scheduling**: Use [cron syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to run scrapers at specific times\n* **Dependencies**: Install required packages like `httpx`, `lxml`\n* **Data Storage**: Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository\n* **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing\n* **Rate Limiting**: Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests\n\nHere\u2019s a sample `scrape.py` that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml:\n\n```\nimport json\nimport httpx\nfrom datetime import datetime, UTC\nfrom lxml import html\nfrom typing import List, Dict\n\n\ndef scrape_imdb() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:\n    \"\"\"Scrape IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml.\n\n    Returns:\n        List of dictionaries containing movie title, year, and rating.\n    \"\"\"\n    headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IMDbBot/1.0)\"}\n    response = httpx.get(\"https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/\", headers=headers)\n    response.raise_for_status()\n\n    tree = html.fromstring(response.text)\n    movies = []\n\n    for item in tree.cssselect(\".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item\"):\n        title = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")\n            else None\n        )\n        year = (\n            item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")\n            else None\n        )\n        rating = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")\n            else None\n        )\n\n        if title and year and rating:\n            movies.append({\"title\": title, \"year\": year, \"rating\": rating})\n\n    return movies\n\n\n# Scrape data and"

They\u2019re perfect for small web tools that *don\u2019t need to run all the time*. Here are some common real-life uses:\n\n* A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\n* A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\n* A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\n* A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\n* A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\n\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they\u2019re done, these copies disappear. It\u2019s cheaper than running a full-time server because you\u2019re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\n\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\n\n* You can\u2019t `pip install` packages - you have to use `requirements.txt`\n* You can\u2019t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\n* You can\u2019t run commands (e.g. `subprocess.run()`)\n\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments.\n\nHere\u2019s a [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python). [Sign-up with Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup). Create an empty `git` repo with this `api/index.py` file.\n\nTo deploy a FastAPI app, add a `requirements.txt` file with `fastapi` as a dependency.\n\n```\nfastapi"

This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky.\n\nLearn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn\u2019t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language.\n\nSome programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly.\n\nLearn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world.\n\nUnicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand:\n\n* **Character Encodings**: Different ways to represent text in computers\n  + ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only\n  + UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII\n  + UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java\n  + UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple\n\nCommon encoding issues you\u2019ll encounter:\n\n```\n# Reading files with explicit encoding\nwith open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    text = f.read()\n\n# Handling encoding errors\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')\n\n# Detecting file encoding\nimport chardet\nwith open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f:\n    result = chardet.detect(f.read())\nprint(result['encoding'])Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n[![Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM - Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You #2 (17 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jeIBNn5Y5fI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/jeIBNn5Y5fI)\n\n[Previous\n\nJavaScript tools: npx](#/npx)\n\n[Next\n\nBrowser: DevTools](#/devtools)"

(This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you **DON\u2019T** need a vector database. You can can use `numpy` for these tasks.)\n\nVector databases are an evolving space.\n\nThe first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called [HNSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world) (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are:\n\n* **[chroma 19,637 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)**\n* **[qdrant 23,341 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant)**\n* **[lancedb 6,327 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb)**\n* **[faiss 34,684 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)**\n* **[milvus 34,476 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus)**\n* **[weaviate 13,222 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)**\n\nIn addition, most relational databases now support vector search.

I\u2019ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?\nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?\nThank you and Regards\nAkshit\n\n---\n\nYes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.\nHowever, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different.\nIs this information available to everyone @carlton sir?\n\n---\n\nHello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir,\nI hope you are doing well.\nAs per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7.\nNow, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks\u2014perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.\nWe sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.\nLooking forward to your kind consideration.\nBest regards,\nDigvijaysinh Chudasama\n\n---\n\nThe Same happened to me.

We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated \u201cbest 4 out of 7\u201d policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity.\n\n---\n\n@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand\nYes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn\u2019t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request.\nThank you\n\n---\n\n@carlton sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge\nIf it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this\nThanking you\nwaiting for your answer"

Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.\nUnfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.\nChanging it now will not suddenly make it eligible.\nThese things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These \u201cminor\u201d things matter.\nIts a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.\nWe had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.\nI know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.\nKindest regards\n\n---\n\nSir,\nThankyou for your prompt reply to my query.\nI wanted to let you know that i had made change of \u2018LICENSE\u2019 to \u2018MIT LICENSE\u2019 on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one"

Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet.

    "content": " delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\nGA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\nProject 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\n\nProject 1"

Any update on this would be helpful.\n\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\n3. ROE Score Update\n\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\n\n\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.\nKind regards\n\n---\n\nWe do not know yet. Please read reply to the original poster.\nThanks,\nKind regards\n\n---\n\nThank you for your response @carlton"

We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.\nLooking forward to your response.\nRegards,\nLakshay"

The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\nToday\u2019s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE.

    "content": "Thread Title: Concerns Regarding TDS Course Difficulty and Grading Fairness\n\nDear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi\nFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\nKey Challenges Faced\n Lack of Prerequisites\nThis course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students\u2014including those from non-technical backgrounds\u2014to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure\nThe difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\nMany students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially for working professionals and students without prior experience.\n Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\nWhile we have put in significant effort\u2014spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and"

This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\nCourse Structuring & Scheduling Issues\n\nMany students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\nThe last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\nThe structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\n\nRequest for Improvement\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\n\nEarly guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline.\nMore structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\nBetter management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\n\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.\n\n---\n\nPlease look into it sir.\n\n---\n\nThank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated.

You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n\n\nThis course is quite hard\nHere\u2019s students\u2019 feedback:\n\nIt used to be an easy course until 2024. # # #\nNow it\u2019s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # #\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #\nLLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably. # #\nThe ROE is hard. #\n\nTake Graded assignment 1 to check if you\u2019re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now.\n\n\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\nAgain to quote Anand:\n\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\nYou CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\nWhy should you copy? Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand what you\u2019re copying.

If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize.\nTo learn better, teach what you\u2019ve learnt.\n\n\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\nOnce again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \u201ctools\u201d, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n@22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access.

But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.\n\n\n---\n\nRegarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I\u2019m speaking for a lot of my peers that we\u2019re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.\nI\u2019m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.\nWhile grades don\u2019t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I\u2019m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\nI understand that the grading can\u2019t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.\n\n---\n\nNicely highlighted the concern of all students.\nTDS as a course has been really tedious this term.

I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.\nCould you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.\nThanks and Regards\nShalini\n\n---\n\nTag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time\u2026\n\n---\n\nIt is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.\nThe problem is the lack of time.\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\nKind regards\n\n---\n\nhi @carlton\nhow are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these doubts. thanks in advance!\n\n---\n\nYou will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.\nI will also add the same in the student seek portal.\nMock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!\nThe gmeet is after the mock ROE where it"

Thanks!\n@carlton @s.anand\ncode to take reference from:\nimport gzip\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nlog_path = 's-anand.net-May-2024.gz'\nstart_time = datetime.strptime('01:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()\nend_time = datetime.strptime('15:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()\nlog_data = []\n\ndef parse_log(line):\n    parts = line.split(' ')\n    log_time = datetime.strptime(parts[3][1:], '%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S')\n    method, url, status = parts[5][1:], parts[6], int(parts[8])\n    return log_time, method, url, status\n\nwith gzip.open(log_path, 'rt') as file:\n    for entry in file:\n        log_time, method, url, status = parse_log(entry)\n        if method == 'GET' and url.startswith('/blog/') and 200 <= status < 300:\n            if log_time.weekday() == 0 and start_time <= log_time.time() < end_time:\n                log_data.append(entry)\n\nprint(f\"Successful GET requests: {len(log_data)}\")\n\nps: I shared code after the deadline hopefully no issues there! \n\n---\n\nI\u2019m also facing same kind of issue in Q3, GA5, while cross checked answer from different methods getting same result 1603, which is showing incorrect.\nKindly check this issue.\nThanks\n\n---\n\nThe same issue is being faced by many students, not only for this condition, but others as well. Please look into it\n\n---\n\nactually i got 130 as answer. but the answer accepted by the portal was 129. i felt like, i have to change one or two numbers front and back, i tried the same before. it worked \n\n---\n\nFor the same question? But it shouldnt be +1 -1 to get the correct answer right.\n\n---\n\nHi @muskan2431"

I am assuming it will have to be changed for Assignment 7 as well.\nPlease let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan accordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic).\n\n---\n\n@Yogesh GA6 will be released sometime this week. All GAs have a minimum 9 days for submissions.\nWe do not have an ETA for Project 2 yet.\nKind regards\n\n---\n\n@carlton\nIf possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance.\n\n---\n\nProject 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.\nProject 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.\nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\nThanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.\nKind regards"

I request the official post to cover these.\n\nSyllabus\nkindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice\nI did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time\nAny mock or resource to practice from?\nadditional tips, if any\n\n\n---\n\n\nModules 1 - 5\nQuestions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules.\nROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame.\nWe will have some past ROEs as practise\n\u2026 watch sessions\n\nKind regards\n\n---\n\nThanks for the answer @carlton\nIs it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a \u201cGA with extremely short deadline\u201d since we don\u2019t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ?\nP.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.\n\n---\n\nSir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs??\n\n---\n\nROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc.\nKind regards\n\n---\n\nThe ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).\nIf your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you\u2026 past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the \u201chooomann\u201d \nSo practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will"

If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens.\nAlso 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins."

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201d\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\nMiranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor\u2019s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"\n\n---\n\ni downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg  and used this\n"

Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\nKind regards\nTDS Team\n\n---\n\n-Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used.\n@carlton @s.anand Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project.\nPlease sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B.\nPlease sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying.\n\n---\n\n@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand\nWe truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -\n\n\nWhy is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course not as a full-time student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\n\n\nWeek 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\n\n\nProject help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team\u2019s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nsir\u2026please extend the deadline\u2026"

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only\u2026 please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\n\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\nRun evalute.py using uv.\n\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\nHope that gives clarity.\nKind regards"

Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.\n\n---\n\n@carlton sir i watch live session recording , but still not getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please . At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .\n\n---\n\nHi Hari,\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\n\n\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\n\n\n\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\n\n\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\nKind regards"

    "content": "Thread Title: Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python\n\nIs it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn\u2019t installing directly via pip be more practical?\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I\u2019d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.\n\n---\n\nYes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n\nIsolation \u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n\nReproducibility \u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n\nPortability \u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\n\u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\nUsing requirements.txt\n\n\u2022 Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup.\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n\u2022 If you don\u2019t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\u2022 If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\nHandling Version Conflicts\n\u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\u2022 Using greater than/less than"

But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone\u2019s project it\u2019s better to use requirements.txt.\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\n\n\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\n\nNever try to list requirements.txt.

That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS.\nIn such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It\u2019s completely IIT Madras\u2019s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises.

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don\u2019t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\nI would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there\u2019s a better way to balance this.\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable."
